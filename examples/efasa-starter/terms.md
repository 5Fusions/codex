# Efasa consent and data handling

- Efasa learns from how you use her (interaction logs such as clicks, prompts, approvals) to improve the product.
- Interaction logs belong to your company; they are not sold or shared.
- No personal client data is collected unless you explicitly enter it; handle any personal data according to your local laws.
- By installing or running Efasa you consent to this learning behavior.
- If you disable logging, some adaptive features will be limited.
